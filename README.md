##  AutoNav Droid: Smart Obstacle Dodging Robot with Mobile App Control

# ABSTRACT

"SmartBot: Bluetooth-Controlled Obstacle Avoidance Robot with Auto-Navigation Mode" is an intelligent robotic system designed to navigate autonomously while providing manual control via a smartphone application developed using MIT App Inventor. The robot is powered by an Arduino microcontroller and utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to detect and avoid obstacles in real-time. The core innovation lies in its dual-mode functionality: a manual mode where users control the robot via Bluetooth using a custom Android app, and an auto-navigation mode where the robot autonomously detects and maneuvers around obstacles without human intervention.
The system is built on a lightweight yet robust chassis, driven by DC motors controlled through an L298N motor driver module. A Bluetooth module enables seamless communication between the robot and the mobile app, offering an interactive and user-friendly control interface. The MIT App features directional controls, a stop button, and an auto-mode toggle for switching between modes on the fly.
This project demonstrates the integration of hardware and software to create a smart mobility solution, ideal for educational, surveillance, and exploration applications. It emphasizes low-cost implementation, modular design, and expandable architecture, making it a scalable foundation for future enhancements such as GPS tracking, voice control, and AI-based path planning. The SmartBot is a step toward accessible robotics, providing hands-on experience with embedded systems, real-time control, and mobile-based automation.
